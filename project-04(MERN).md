### Task - To deploy a simple To-Do application that creates To-Do lists

### STEP 1 â€“ BACKEND CONFIGURATION

#### Steps
* Update ubuntu: `sudo apt update`
* Upgrade ubuntu: `sudo apt upgrade`
* Get the location of Node.js software from Ubuntu repositories. Run: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -`
.

* Install Node.js on the server with this command: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs` This command installs both nodejs and npm. NPM is a package manager for Node like apt for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts. 
* Verify the node installation with this command: `node -v`
* Verify the npm installation with this command: `npm -v`
.

##### Application Code Setup
* Create a new directory for your To-Do project: `mkdir Todo`
* Run the command below to verify that the Todo directory is created, run: `ls`
* Next, change the current directory to the newly created one: `cd Todo`
* Next, you will use the command npm init to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Run the command: `npm init` then follow the prompt and finally answer yes to write out the package file.
.

* Run the command `ls` to confirm that you have package.json file created.
