# MEAN-STACK



###  [What is Mean Stack]
MEAN stack is a collection of JavaScript technologies used to develop web applications. It stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Express.js is a web application framework, AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. Together, these technologies provide an end-to-end framework for developing web applications using only JavaScript.


###  MEAN STACK is comprised of four different technologies:
*   **M**ongoDB (Document database): Stores and retrieve data.
    
*   **E**xpress JS (Back-end application framework): Makes requests to Database and returns a response
    
*   **A**ngularJS (Front-end application framework): Handles Client and Server Requests
    
*   **N**ode.js (JavaScript runtime environment): Accept requests and display results to end user
    

The MEAN stack has variants like MERN (replacing Angular.js with React.js) and MEVN (using Vue.js). One of the most popular technological concepts for creating web apps is the MEAN stack.


###  How Does the MEAN Stack Work?
*   The MEAN stack works by using each of the technologies in the stack to handle specific parts of the web development process.
    

*   MongoDB is used to store and manage the application's data. It uses a document-oriented data model, which makes it easy to work with JSON data.
    
*   Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It is used to handle routing, middleware, and other back-end tasks. It allows the exposure of APIs and handles requests and responses from the client.
    
*   AngularJS (or Angular) is a JavaScript framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications. It provides a powerful set of tools for building the front end of the application, including data binding, directives, and dependency injection.
    

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It provides an environment for running Express.js and handles server-side logic and database interactions.

The MEAN stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, throughout the entire web development process, from the front end to the back end, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.


###  
While the MEAN stack isn’t perfect for every application, there are many uses where it excels. It’s a strong choice for developing cloud-native applications because of its scalability and its ability to manage concurrent users. 
The AngularJS frontend framework also makes it ideal for developing single-page applications that serve all information and functionality on a single page. Here are a few examples of using MEAN:**

*   Calendars
    
*   Expense tracking
    
*   News aggregation sites
    
*   Mapping and location finding
