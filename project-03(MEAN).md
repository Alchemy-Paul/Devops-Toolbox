# MEAN-STACK



###  [What is Mean Stack]
MEAN stack is a collection of JavaScript technologies used to develop web applications. It stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Express.js is a web application framework, AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. Together, these technologies provide an end-to-end framework for developing web applications using only JavaScript.


###  MEAN STACK is comprised of four different technologies:
*   **M**ongoDB (Document database): Stores and retrieve data.
    
*   **E**xpress JS (Back-end application framework): Makes requests to Database and returns a response
    
*   **A**ngularJS (Front-end application framework): Handles Client and Server Requests
    
*   **N**ode.js (JavaScript runtime environment): Accept requests and display results to end user
    

The MEAN stack has variants like MERN (replacing Angular.js with React.js) and MEVN (using Vue.js). One of the most popular technological concepts for creating web apps is the MEAN stack.
